A simple application using Vue3, Amplify, API Gateway, and DynamoDB

This was complete on a guest account on a someone else's laptop as I am currently house sitting and the access to the laptop from my previous employer has been deactivated

As this is the case, there were restrictions on things I could do due to lack of admin rights:
- I was unable to install any styling (such as vuetify or bootstrap)
- I was unable to push any changes to AWS Amplify's function, therefore making it impossible for me to correctly specify what should be returned from a "/cakes" request

To run, enter `npm run dev`
